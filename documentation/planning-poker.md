# Planning Poker Sprint 2
For Sprint 2, we used Planning Poker to estimate the time required for each user story. We followed the following scale::

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
- With 1 representing the smallest user story and 5 representing the largest.

This scale is based on the Knowledgebase (see https://knowledgebase.hbo-ict-hva.nl/2_professional_skills/toekomstgericht_organiseren/managen/planningpoker/)

## Weight per user-story
These are the weights (time estimates) we assigned to each user story.

| User-story | Weight |
|------------|--------|
| #1         | 3      |
| #2         | 4      |
| #3         |        |
| #4         |        |
| #5         | 3      |
| #6         | 3      |
| #7         | 3      |
| #8         | 5      |
| #9         | 2      |
| #10        | 3      |
| #11        | 3      |
| #12        | 3      |
| #13        | 5      |
| #14        | 3      |
| #15        | 2      |
| #16        | 2      |
| #17        | 1      |
| #18        | 3      |
| #19        | 3      |
| #20        | 3      |
## Task distribution
After this, we divided the user stories. Everyone was first given the opportunity to select a user story based on their preference. Then, the remaining user stories were assigned based on their weight, and we calculated the total weight per person. Based on this, we adjusted the distribution until we had balanced weights and everyone was satisfied.
