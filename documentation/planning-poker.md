# Planning Poker Sprint 2
For Sprint 2, we used Planning Poker to estimate the time required for each user story. We followed the following scale::

- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
- With 1 representing the smallest user story and 5 representing the largest.

This scale is based on the Knowledgebase (see https://knowledgebase.hbo-ict-hva.nl/2_professional_skills/toekomstgericht_organiseren/managen/planningpoker/)

## Weight per user-story
These are the weights (time estimates) we assigned to each user story.
