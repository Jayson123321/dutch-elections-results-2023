# Research: Implementing Multilingual Support in Web Applications

## Introduction
The goal of multilingual support in web applications is to provide users with access to information in their preferred language, promoting inclusivity and accessibility. In this project, multilingual support is implemented using Vue.js for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Technical Approach

### Frontend: Vue.js
Vue.js offers a robust library called Vue I18n, designed to simplify the integration of multilingual support:
1. **Installation**: Vue I18n is added to the project using npm.
2. **Configuration**: Language files (e.g., `en.json` and `nl.json`) are stored in a `locales` folder.
3. **Integration**: Dynamic translations are applied to UI elements such as buttons and labels using `$t()` functions.
4. **Language Switching**: Users can easily toggle between supported languages via a dropdown menu or buttons.
5. **Fallback Mechanism**: If a translation is unavailable, the system defaults to a pre-defined language (e.g., English).

## Why `i181n.js` Instead of an API

You have chosen to use `i181n.js` instead of an API for the following reasons:

1. **Privacy and Association**: Since this is a school project, we prefer not to use external APIs like those from Google. Using external APIs can lead to privacy issues and require API keys that are linked to your account.

2. **Simplicity and Control**: By using `i181n.js`, you have full control over the translations and implementation. This makes it easier to make adjustments and manage translations without relying on an external service.

3. **Cost**: External APIs can incur costs, especially as your project grows and requires more translations. By using `i181n.js`, you avoid these costs.

4. **Offline Access**: `i181n.js` works entirely locally within your application, meaning translations are available even without an internet connection. This is not possible with an external API.

5. **Speed**: Using local translations with `i181n.js` can be faster than making network requests to an external API, which benefits the performance of your application.

## How Major Companies Handle Multilingual Support

### Google
- **Approach**: Google employs a globalized infrastructure with automatic language detection based on user location, browser settings, and explicit user preferences.
- **Tools**: Uses advanced machine learning for translations, combined with human-reviewed localization for accuracy.
- **Features**: Offers more than 100 languages across platforms with consistent UI/UX design tailored to local cultures.

### Facebook
- **Approach**: Facebook enables users to select their language manually while providing automatic recommendations based on user location.
- **Community Contributions**: Facebook leverages crowdsourcing, allowing users to suggest and vote on translations.
- **Reach**: Supports over 100 languages and dialects, with regional customizations (e.g., different Spanish variants).

### Airbnb
- **Approach**: Uses a service-oriented architecture with localized content for properties, reviews, and UI.
- **Dynamic Localization**: Airbnb’s system dynamically adjusts the UI and content based on user preferences and context.
- **Testing**: Implements rigorous A/B testing to ensure translations resonate with the target audience.

### Spotify
- **Approach**: Spotify integrates multilingual support directly into its mobile and web apps using translation files.
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Ensures that localized content (e.g., song recommendations and playlists) aligns with regional preferences.
- **Language Switching**: Allows users to manually switch languages in settings, ensuring a user-controlled experience.

## Ethical and Practical Benefits

1. **Inclusivity and Accessibility**:
   - Providing multilingual support ensures the application is accessible to users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.
   - It fosters equality by allowing everyone to interact with the application regardless of language barriers.

2. **User Trust and Transparency**:
   - Users are more likely to trust applications that communicate clearly in their preferred language.
   - Multilingual support aligns with global standards and legal frameworks (e.g., GDPR), ensuring transparency in data usage.

3. **Scalability and Reach**:
   - Applications with multilingual support can attract a global audience, expanding their user base and relevance.

4. **Cultural Sensitivity**:
   - Adapting to local languages reflects respect for cultural differences, enhancing user satisfaction.
